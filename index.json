This blog will give a very brief introduction and background of the Majorana zero modes and way to obtain them in a simple model known as the Kitaev Chain. The aim will be to translate the Kitaev Chain Hamiltonian into a Matrix form to obtain energy spectrum and edge modes for an open chain. We will obtain these Majorana zero modes at the edges of an open chain.\nMajorana Fermions In the year 1937, a new class of particles that are its own anti-particles were hypothesized by Ettore Majorana. This new class were termed Majorana fermions or particles for obvious reasons. They can be mathematically represented by creation and anhilation operators in second quantization:\n$$\\gamma^\\dagger_k = \\gamma_k$$ where, $\\gamma_k$: anhilates a particle in quantum state k; $\\gamma_k^\\dagger$: creates a particle in quantum state k\nThe equation above conveys that the operators for creating and destroying the particles are same, which is the desired property of the Majorana in contrast to Dirac fermions for which they are distinct. The above operators shall be referred as Majorana operators. There are several conventions to define these Majorana operators. We will be adopting the following($f$ is the fermionic operator):\n\\begin{align} f^\\dagger = (\\gamma_1 + i\\gamma_2)/2 \\nonumber \\qquad f = (\\gamma_1 - i\\gamma_2)/2 \\label{2} \\end{align}\nUsing this definition, the following identities can be checked\n$\\gamma_k^2 = 1$ $\\left[\\gamma_i,\\gamma_j\\right] = 2\\delta_{ij}$ There have been lot of attempts in experimental high energy physics to hunt these particles.\nMajorana Zero Modes Let’s shift gears and enter the realm of condensed matter physics. In superconducting materials, certain quasiparticle(Bogoliubov) excitations display similar properties as that of Majorana fermions. The Majorana zero mode(MZM) is a special case of Bogoliubov quasiparticle operators which are linear combinations of electron and hole operator. The MZM satisfy the properties that they square to identity and are self-Hermitian.\nIf we look carefully at above equations, the two Majorana modes always occurs in pair for a single fermionic mode. Can we decouple them? This was cleverly answered by Professor Alexei Kitaev in 2001, through his Kitaev chain, which is a 1D p-wave superconducting model.\nKitaev Chain Kitaev Chain is a tight binding lattice model of spinless electrons with nearest-neighbour hopping amplitude $t$, a p-wave superconducting pairing term $\\Delta$ for nearest neighbours and on-site chemical potential $\\mu$. The hamiltonian for a finite and open chain in second quantization can be jotted down \\begin{equation} \\hat{H} = \\sum_{n=1}^{N-1}\\left[t\\left(f_n^\\dagger f_{n+1} + f_{n+1}^\\dagger f_n\\right) + \\Delta\\left(f_n f_{n+1} + f_{n+1}^\\dagger f_n^\\dagger\\right)\\right] - \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\mu \\left( 2f_n^\\dagger f_n - 1 \\right) \\label{real_space_Hamiltonian} \\end{equation} where $t,\\Delta$ and $\\mu$ are all real and $\\gamma \u0026gt; 0$ without loss of generality. Similar to the definition above, we define the following Majorana operators \\begin{align} a_{2n-1} = f_n + f_n^\\dagger \\quad \\text{and} \\quad a_{2n} = i(f_n - f_n^\\dagger) \\label{4} \\end{align} for n = 1,2,…,N. The Kitaev Chain Hamiltonian can be rewritten in terms of these Majorana operators \\begin{equation} \\hat{H} = i\\sum_{n=1}^{N-1} \\left[J_xa_{2n}a_{2n+1} - J_ya_{2n-1} a_{2n+2}\\right] + i\\sum_{n=1}^{N}\\mu a_{2n-1}a_{2n} \\end{equation} where, $J_x = \\frac{1}{2}(t - \\Delta) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad J_y = \\frac{1}{2}(t + \\Delta)$\nLet us carefully examine the Hamiltonian in the Majorana basis. A brief look will help us solve the problem of decoupling. Let us look at two special cases in the parameter space of $t, \\Delta$ and $\\mu$.\nCase I: $t = \\Delta$ and $\\mu = 0$\nThe conditions clearly imply $J_x=0$ and $J_y=t$ which results in \\begin{equation} \\hat{H} = -i\\sum_{n=1}^{N-1} \\left[t a_{2n-1} a_{2n+2}\\right] \\label{6} \\end{equation}\nDid we end up finding something interesting? A close attention to the equation above reveals that the even(odd) Majorana mode at the left(right) end has vanished and it is decoupled from the rest of the modes. This is exactly what we set out for! The unpaired Majorana modes.\nCase II: $t = -\\Delta$ and $\\mu = 0$\nThis time $J_y = 0$ and $J_x = t$ which results in \\begin{equation} \\hat{H} = i\\sum_{n=1}^{N-1} \\left[t a_{2n}a_{2n+1}\\right] \\end{equation}\nThis time, the odd(even) Majorana mode at the left(right) end of the chain is unpaired with the rest of the chain.\nWonderful!

I am following ‘The Oxford Solid state Basics’ book by Prof. Steven H. Simon. If the material covered is unclear, please refer the book suggested above. In any case, go through that book. It is a lovely book to read!\nHistorical note: It was well known that the heat capacity per atom for a solid is given by $C \\approx 3k_B$ or in other terms, molar heat capacity is $C \\approx 3R$, where $R$ is the Universal gas constant. This empirical observation was known as Dulong-Petit Law.\nLet us look at heat capacities for different chemicals at room temperature($T = 25^oC$)1:\nThe above figure shows the heat capacities for various chemical elements at a temperature of 25 $^0C$ and a pressure of 100kPa. It is evident that most of them follow Dulong-Petit Law.\nHow do we explain this empirical observation? The answer was provided by Boltzmann using classical statistical mechanics. We will take his approach and understand the source of this empirical law.\nBoltzmann approach: Classical Statistical Mechanics The key idea in his approach was to assume atoms inside a solid to be in a harmonic potential under the influence of neighbouring atoms: Imagine the same model with chain of such atoms forming a solid in 3 spatial dimensions(3D) at a fixed temperature T. Now, the Hamiltonian for each atom can be written as: $$ \\mathcal{H}(\\mathbf{q},\\mathbf{p}) = \\frac{\\mathbf{p}^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2\\mathbf{q}^2$$\nNote:\nWe assumed the spring constant to be same in all three dimensions. Quantities $\\mathbf{p}$ and $\\mathbf{q}$ are three dimensional vectors. Since we have a large collection of such atoms at a fixed temperature T, we can find its energy and heat constant using classical canonical partition function. The single-particle partition function is given by, $$ Z_1 = \\frac{1}{h^3}\\int\\int e^{-\\beta \\mathcal{H}(\\mathbf{q},\\mathbf{p})}d\\mathbf{q}d\\mathbf{p}$$\nWe shall explicitly evaluate this quantity. It will be handy to recall the Gaussian integral of one variable: $$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-ax^2}dx = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{a}}$$\nLet us get our hands dirty!\n$$Z_1 = \\frac{1}{h^3}\\int\\int e^{-\\beta(\\frac{\\mathbf{p}^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2\\mathbf{q}^2)}d\\mathbf{q}d\\mathbf{p} \\ = \\frac{1}{h^3} \\int exp{\\frac{-\\beta\\mathbf{p}^2}{2m}} d\\mathbf{p} \\int exp{\\frac{-\\beta m\\omega^2}{2}\\mathbf{q}^2} d\\mathbf{q} $$\nWe can further separate the 3D integral into a product of three 1D integrals in both momentum and position coordinates.\n$$ \\begin{align} Z_1 = \\frac{1}{h^3} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} exp{\\frac{-\\beta{p_x}^2}{2m}} dp_x \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} exp{\\frac{-\\beta{p_y}^2}{2m}} dp_y \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} exp{\\frac{-\\beta{p_z}^2}{2m}} dp_z \\\\\\ \\text{x} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} exp{\\frac{-\\beta m\\omega^2q_x^2}{2}} dq_x \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} exp{\\frac{-\\beta m\\omega^2q_y^2}{2}} dq_y \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} exp{\\frac{-\\beta m\\omega^2q_z^2}{2}} dq_z \\end{align} $$\n$$= \\frac{1}{h^3} \\left[\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} exp{\\frac{-\\beta{p_x}^2}{2m}} dp_x\\right]^3 \\left[\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} exp{\\frac{-\\beta m\\omega^2q_x^2}{2}} dq_x\\right]^3$$ Using the 1D Gaussian integrals above, we get\n$$ Z_1 = \\frac{1}{h^3} \\left[\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi m}{\\beta}}\\right]^3 \\left[\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{\\beta m \\omega^2}} \\right]^3 = \\left[\\frac{k_B T}{\\hbar\\omega}\\right]^3$$ where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $\\hbar = h/2\\pi$. The N particle partition function can be obtained by assuming that the particles are distinguishable: $$Z_N = [Z_1]^N = \\left[\\frac{k_B T}{\\hbar\\omega}\\right]^{3N}$$\nWe know, from the connection to thermodynamic quantities, the internal energy of this system can be obtained by $$ E = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\beta}lnZ_N = 3Nk_BT$$\nThus, the heat capacity per atom is $$C_v = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} \\frac{E}{N} = 3k_B$$\nHooray! We have obtained our result of $3k_B$ for the specific heat. Boltzmann’s idea worked and we can now explain this empirical observation. Thus, Boltzmann accounted lattice vibrations as the source for the heat capacity and modelled it classically as masses connected by a spring.\nIs it the end of the story? Even the graph above will tell you that there are outliers to this empirical law. Particularly, heat capacity of diamond deviates from Dulong-Petit law at room temperatures. Also, heat capacity strongly depends on temperature, and becomes smaller at lower temperatures(Apparently room temperature is a “low” temperature for diamond). What are we missing here? Einstein came up with a brilliant idea to consider quantum mechanics as the key here.\nEinstein’s approach: Quantum Harmonic Oscillator Einstein followed a similar approach to that of Boltzmann except, he used quantized harmonic oscillator levels for each atom, given by $$\\epsilon_n = \\hbar \\omega(n+3/2)$$\nwhere $n = n_x+n_y+n_z$.
